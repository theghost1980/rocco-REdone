Main idea:
    - The main component to be shown is a "hand made" carrousel.
        -> This component load the "page" when the user:
            - click on left/right arrow || hit keyboard arrows.
        -> by doing this we can set a state, maybe using redux or just context to handle:
            -> dark/light mode
            -> user status: visitor, admin, logged.
                -> the logged(maybe using google or created account, which implies mail confirmation), can download the books and read most recent Rocco's posts.
                -> this open the possibility to have paid users and payment methods.
